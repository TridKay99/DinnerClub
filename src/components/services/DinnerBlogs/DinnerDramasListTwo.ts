  If you need a cheap, tasty meal at a restaurant that actually might’ve hired an interior designer then Tao’s your place.</br>
  Oh god does that restaurant fuck on the first date. Tao really delivered on the dumps this fine evening, a solid 8/10.</br>
  </br>
  Really liked the diverse age range that this place brings in! Tao's food is so highly regarded, due to its rich taste and excellent flavour, 
  it’s harder to get into than Dorcia on a Friday night.</br> 
  Great dumplings, good friends, free Hong Kong xx</br>

  In contrast to yet another cold and wet Friday night, Dinner Club’s taste buds were transported to tropical South East Asia, where we were treated to some delectable Thai.</br>
  </br>
  Christian ‘Pad Simi Ew’ Simitzis, once again demanded we get him the Chicky Chicky Pad See Ew just to tickle his sick Pad See Ew needs. He later admitted he has never once 
  tried any other Thai dish in his life. The devilish grin on his face as he ate was quite sickening, however, his recommendation was spot on and paired exceptionally 
  well with their Roti and Satay Sauce. Trust me that roti with satay wine and dined me but didn’t fuck me at all.</br>
  </br>
  Other dishes of note included the Masaman Curry and the Tom Yum Soup, which nourished not only my body, but my soul. Good use of spice but I feel like they toned it 
  down as I’m sure in the past many Aussies have complained about it being “too bloody spicy”. Only issue was the mains took too long and made me finish my entire bottle 
  of wine early.</br>
  </br>
  Food – 9/10</br>
  Weather – 0.4/10</br>
  Friends – 3/10</br>
  Below is an example of the 3/10</br>

  This week took us Parma Fridays down at the Vale but we were, unfortunately, a man down as Panini D Dragon had a zorba circle 
  to attend to with his work colleagues. In his absence, Michael Jordan joined the gang for a Parma and Pint combo meal deal which 
  was amazing value. Parms were a bit cheesy and lacked napoli sauce but still good for its buck!
  </br>
  </br>
  We requested Jager bombs to give us some life energy for the night’s festivities. 
  Unfortunately, this left the young bartender embarrassed because she didn't know how to make a Jager bomb and shocked 
  that these men would even consider a 7.30 pm bomb in front of a room full of families just finishing entrees. 
  $15 ea. for the bombs which is just ridiculous.</br>

  </br>
  </br>
  7/10 Will be back for the combo</br>
  </br>
  Hot tip: Create a 12-month mentoring program to educate the young bartenders to make a Jager bomb.

  KBBQ Fridays, a special treat that the members love to delve into only a few times a year. Subi Q was the restaurant of choice, 
  just 100m down from Bistro Thierry and across the road from Hobba café, where Kevin Costaner (Trid) and Lord Smitzis lost their brunch virginities.</br>

  </br>
  Food was amazing, sizzled to bloody perfection! Beef Bugolgi and the KFC wings were a big hoot, leaving Panini D Dragon in a great mood after his incredibly authoritarian style of 
  restaurant ordering. Although, the members did have a little trouble adapting to the iron weapons that the Koreans manufactured. 
  The chopsticks were to slippery for our greasy western grip!</br>

  The meal before the members fuck it off forever

  Environment: 7</br>
  Rice: 7</br>
  Chopsticks: 2</br>
  </br>
  Hot tip: don’t be fancy with iron chopsticks, wood and bamboo chopsticks work fine as seen everywhere but Korea. An Iron spork will also do.
