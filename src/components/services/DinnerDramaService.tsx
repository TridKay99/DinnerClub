hmmm where do i start?

The cutlery and plates showed a real authentic Asian twist to an entitled suburban environment that Richmond usually has to offer.
The food was above average, with a quality pork belly but a not so quality braised fuck. 
Another issue that I didn't really enjoy was how they served duck on duck.

Upon entering we were informed we only had until 7:30 to indulge in provender. 
This proved to not be an issue as the service was very fast. Well done on your quick juicy dumpers.
</br>
</br>
The muscular blonde man sitting opposite me seemed to be pleasantly surprised with the juicy dumpers on offer at I Love Dumplings also;
Although without labeled vinegar and soy sauce, the muscular man buggered up his mixture. He was very upset.
