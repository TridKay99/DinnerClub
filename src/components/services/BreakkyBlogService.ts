  A windy saturday morning brunch down at Beans Republique with Kevin Constaner attempting to sit next to me, not across.
  Once again the menu didn't have 'eggs your way', this could be a Stonnington council issue as eggs your way is everywhere 
  in South Yarrakian region. Coffees were a solid 8, took bloody years to come though!
  </br>
  </br>
  Hot tips: when I order a coffee I would like it in t-minus 5 minutes. Maybe fire the barista for ruining my life. 8/10 ill come back.

  The atmosphere at Mr.Foxx was rather pleasant for a Saturday brunch outing, although a few hiccups with the waiter. 
  I, as the customer, had to correct him about one of the most popular items on the meny. It's egg your way, not whatever...

  A terrible combination of the shakiest table in the world and a battle between a blunt knife and some sourdough ended with coffee 
  flying everywhere against our will. 7/10 coffee needs to be better... maybe fire the barista.
