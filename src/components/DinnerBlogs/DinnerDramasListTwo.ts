  If you need a cheap, tasty meal at a restaurant that actually might’ve hired an interior designer then Tao’s your place.</br>
  Oh god does that restaurant fuck on the first date. Tao really delivered on the dumps this fine evening, a solid 8/10.</br>

  Really liked the diverse age range that this place brings in! Tao's food is so highly regarded, due to its rich taste and excellent flavour, 
  it’s harder to get into than Dorcia on a Friday night.</br> 
  Great dumplings, good friends, free Hong Kong xx</br>

  Environment 7/10</br>
  Food 8/10</br>
