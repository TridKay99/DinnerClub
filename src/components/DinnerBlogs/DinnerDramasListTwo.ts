  If you need a cheap, tasty meal at a restaurant that actually might’ve hired an interior designer then Tao’s your place.</br>
  Oh god does that restaurant fuck on the first date. Tao really delivered on the dumps this fine evening, a solid 8/10.</br>
  </br>
  Really liked the diverse age range that this place brings in! Tao's food is so highly regarded, due to its rich taste and excellent flavour, 
  it’s harder to get into than Dorcia on a Friday night.</br> 
  Great dumplings, good friends, free Hong Kong xx</br>

  In contrast to yet another cold and wet Friday night, Dinner Club’s taste buds were transported to tropical South East Asia, where we were treated to some delectable Thai.</br>
  </br>
  Christian ‘Pad Simi Ew’ Simitzis, once again demanded we get him the Chicky Chicky Pad See Ew just to tickle his sick Pad See Ew needs. He later admitted he has never once 
  tried any other Thai dish in his life. The devilish grin on his face as he ate was quite sickening, however, his recommendation was spot on and paired exceptionally 
  well with their Roti and Satay Sauce. Trust me that roti with satay wine and dined me but didn’t fuck me at all.</br>
  </br>
  Other dishes of note included the Masaman Curry and the Tom Yum Soup, which nourished not only my body, but my soul. Good use of spice but I feel like they toned it 
  down as I’m sure in the past many Aussies have complained about it being “too bloody spicy”. Only issue was the mains took too long and made me finish my entire bottle 
  of wine early.</br>

  Food – 9/10</br>
  Weather – 0.4/10</br>
  Friends – 3/10</br>
  Below is an example of the 3/10</br>
