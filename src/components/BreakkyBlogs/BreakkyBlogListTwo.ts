  Great brunch outting this weekend, Moby had the 'eggs your way on toast', yes on toast. We will let it slide!</br>
  It was a solid 7 only because of the mushys.</br>
  Bread was a tad too hard to cut with my knife, leaving me to flex my guns to get into the pesky crust!</br>
  Service was a bit slow but they made up for it with their great knowledge of anatomy and the location of the larynx</br>
  The mimosas where satisfying but it was a shock to my ear holes to find out they didn't have bloody marys.</br>
